## Summary of DRUVA
1. DRUVA contains video sequences of 20 different artifacts (artifacts are mainly submerged rocks of dimension 0.5 meters to 1 meter) in shallow waters.
1. Each video contains an almost 360◦ azimuthal view of the artifact with a scene depth of 0.5 to 4 meters.
1. DRUVA is captured using GoPro Hero 10 Black camera with 30 fps and 1920 × 1080 resolution. It contains the intrinsics of the camera also.
1. DRUVA can be used by underwater (UW) researchers for 3D reconstruction, novel view-synthesis using neural radiance fields (NeRFs), video interpolation, and extrapolation, to name a few.
